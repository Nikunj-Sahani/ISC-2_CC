   - Hybrid

- [ ] 𝐐.**7** - **What does the NAC device provide for access security and incident response?**
   - Network visibility

- [ ] 𝐐.**8** - **How can logical network segmentation be imposed on embedded systems and IoT devices?**
   - Through traffic-control means, including VLANs, MAC addresses, IP addresses, physical ports, protocols, or application filtering

- [ ] 𝐐.**9** - **What information would be removed from a threat alert to maintain anonymity?**
   - Host name and username

- [ ] 𝐐.**10** - **What protocol is often used by embedded systems when connected to a corporate network?**
   - TCP/IP

- [ ] 𝐐.**11** - **Which layer of the OSI model corresponds to the Internet Layer in the TCP/IP protocol architecture?**
